# Vivin Rakul Portfolio

This is my personal professional portfolio website built using React and Vite.  
It showcases my projects, technical skills, resume, and contact details as a Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student.

This portfolio is designed to present my profile in a clean, modern, and industry-standard format for internships, placements, and job opportunities.
